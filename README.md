The method has incorporated TF-IDF vectorization, Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of data, K-Means clustering to group similar documents, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation for effective topic modeling. The system functions on vast datasets from the world's prominent academic databases: ArXiv and Google Scholar. The system has been designed to calibrate with individual research preferences; hence, the time utilized in research work has been reduced to a great extent, and there has been effective in-target literature digging and interdisciplinary scholarly collaboration.
